# number-facts
This website use api to generate random facts related to numbers that user inputs.
It works perfectly on your local host.
This will not work in Chrome because this API call have HTTP instead of HTTPS. 
But you can still use it by changing some chrome settings.
Steps are as follows:-
1.Go to chrome settings.
2.Then go to Privacy and Settings.
3.Go to site settings.
4.Go to additional content settings.
5.Then go to Insecure settings.
6.And now add your url to this.

That's it now this will work perfectly.

I learned this from Traversy Media. So, thanks to Brad Traversy.
